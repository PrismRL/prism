## prism

**prism** is a roguelike game engine written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) for use with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), inspired by Bob Nystrom's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxI3Eu5DPwE) on roguelike architecture. It utilizes the **command pattern** and **composition** to provide a modular, extensible foundation for creating turn-based games.

Released under the **MIT License**, prism is free to use for both personal and commercial projects.

## Features

- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates changes in state as objects, enabling clean and decoupled turn-based mechanics.
- **Composition-Based Design**: Promotes flexibility and reusability using composition to build entities.
- **Event Listener System**: React to in-game events dynamically for things like status effects, traps, and environmental interactions.
- **Lightweight and Modular**: Built in Lua, prism is designed to be lean and easy to use.
- **In-Game Editor**: Geometer is a powerful in-game editor designed for rapid prototyping and debugging. Inspired by classic roguelike Wizard Modes, it lets you instantly spawn actors, modify terrain, and interact with the level like a paint program—making iteration fast and intuitive.
