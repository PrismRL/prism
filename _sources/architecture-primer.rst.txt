Prism's Architecture: A Primer
==============================
This is an overview of how a game made with Prism fits together.

Actors
------
Actors are the entities that populate the game world. They include the player, monsters, items, chests,
and any other interactive elements. Each actor consists of components—data structures that define their
state and behavior.

Components
----------

Components store the data that define an actor or cell’s properties and abilities. A monster’s health, a poison
effect, or a cell's opacity are all represented as components. Components determine what actions
an actor can perform.

Actions
-------

Actions are how actors interact with the game world. Moving, attacking, and casting spells are all actions.
Actions require actors to have specific components and trigger state changes within the level.

Systems
-------

Systems handle game logic based on events. They process changes, such as reducing an actor’s health due to
poison at the end of their turn or checking if a floating creature should fall into a pit. Systems operate
at the level-wide scale being fed all events from that level.

Level
-----

The level manages all actors and maintains the game state. It tracks turns, processes actions, moves actors,
and holds the map and various caches for the game world.

Cells
-----

Cells define the physical structure of the level. They represent terrain elements such as walls, floors,
water, and lava—determining where actors can move and interact.
