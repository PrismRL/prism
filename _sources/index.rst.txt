Prism
=====

A comprehensive traditional roguelike engine for `LÃ–VE <https://love2d.org/>`_.

"Traditional" roguelike?
------------------------

Prism is geared towards classic roguelike games like `NetHack <https://www.nethack.org/>`_ or 
`Brogue <https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/>`_, turn-based games set in randomly generated grid levels. 
Other turn-based tactics games might also be a good fit.
