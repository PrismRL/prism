Taking flight
=============

Unfortunately for kobolds, they can't fly. In this section we're going to 
create a :lua:class:`System` that plunges actors into the abyss if they're unable
to fly.

Creating the void component
---------------------------

First we'll need to create a component we'll put on cells to indicate they're a place you
can fall.

1. Navigate to ``modules/MyGame/components``
2. Create a new file called ``void.lua``

Put the following into ``void.lua``:

.. code:: lua

   --- @class Void : Component
   local Void = prism.Component:extend("Void")

   return Void

This is a simple tag component that we'll use to mark tiles where actors can fall if they don’t have 
an allowed movement type.

Adding void to our pit
----------------------

1. Navigate to ``modules/MyGame/cells/pit.lua``

Add the following line to its components:

.. code:: lua  

   prism.components.Void()

Creating the fall action
------------------------

Next we're going to create an lua:class:`Action` to represent an actor falling.

1. Navigate to the ``modules/MyGame/actions`` directory.
2. Create a new file called ``fall.lua``.
3. Define the ``Fall`` action:

.. code:: lua

   --- @class Fall : Action
   --- @overload fun(owner: Actor): Fall
   local Fall = prism.Action:extend "Fall"

   return Fall

To perform the fall itself, all we're going to do is remove the actor:

.. code:: lua

   function Fall:perform(level)
      level:removeActor(self.owner) -- into the depths with you!
   end

Determining whether we `should` fall is a bit more complex. We need the following to be true:

The cell we're standing on has the void component, which we can check simply:

.. code:: lua

   --- @param level Level
   function Fall:canPerform(level)
      local x, y = self.owner:getPosition():decompose()
      local cell = level:getCell(x, y)

      -- We can only fall on cells that are voids.
      if not cell:has(prism.components.Void) then return false end


And that we can't move through the cell. We can get the cell's collision mask and compare it with our own
with :lua:func:`Collision.checkBitmaskOverlap` to accomplish that check:

.. code:: lua

      local cellMask = cell:getCollisionMask()
      local mover = self.owner:get(prism.components.Mover)
      local mask = mover and mover.mask or 0 -- default to the immovable mask

      -- We have a Void component on the cell. If the actor CAN'T move here
      -- then they fall.
      return not prism.Collision.checkBitmaskOverlap(cellMask, mask)
   end

   return Fall


.. dropdown:: Complete fall.lua

   `Source <https://github.com/PrismRL/Kicking-Kobolds/blob/part2/modules/MyGame/actions/fall.lua>`_

   .. code:: lua

      --- @class Fall : Action
      --- @overload fun(owner: Actor): Fall
      local Fall = prism.Action:extend "Fall"

      --- @param level Level
      function Fall:canPerform(level)
         local x, y = self.owner:getPosition():decompose()
         local cell = level:getCell(x, y)

         -- We can only fall on cells that are voids.
         if not cell:has(prism.components.Void) then return false end

         local cellMask = cell:getCollisionMask()
         local mover = self.owner:get(prism.components.Mover)
         local mask = mover and mover.mask or 0 -- default to the immovable mask

         -- We have a Void component on the cell. If the actor CAN'T move here
         -- then they fall.
         return not prism.Collision.checkBitmaskOverlap(cellMask, mask)
      end

      --- @param level Level
      function Fall:perform(level)
         level:perform(prism.actions.Die(self.owner))
      end

      return Fall


Triggering fall with a system
-----------------------------

We've defined a fall action, but kobolds aren’t exactly volunteering to fall into the void.

Let's create a :lua:class:`System`` to make sure things fall when they ought to.

1. Navigate to the ``modules/MyGame/`` directory.
2. Create a new folder called ``systems`` if it doesn't exist.
3. Create a new file in that folder named ``fallsystem.lua``.

We want the actor to fall immediately when they land on a valid tile, so we'll use the
:lua:func:`System.onMove` callback to apply the fall action whenever valid:

.. code:: lua

   --- @class FallSystem : System
   local FallSystem = prism.System:extend "FallSystem"

   --- @param level Level
   --- @param actor Actor
   function FallSystem:onMove(level, actor)
      local fall = prism.actions.Fall(actor)

      if level:canPerform(fall) then
         level:perform(fall)
      end
   end

   return FallSystem

.. note::

   See :lua:class:`System` for a listing of events you can hook into!

Registering the Fall system
---------------------------

Navigate back to ``MyGamelevelstate.lua`` and on line 32 you'll see where we register systems. Go ahead and add
``prism.systems.Fall()`` to the bottom of the list like so.

.. code:: lua

   local level = prism.Level(map, actors, {
      prism.systems.Senses(),
      prism.systems.Sight(),
      prism.systems.Fall(),
   })

Wrapping up
-----------

With our ``FallSystem`` in place, kobolds and other unfortunate creatures will now tumble 
into the void if they end their turn standing on a pit they can’t fly over.
We’ve used a component to tag dangerous tiles, an action to represent involuntary movement,
and a system to enforce game logic based on actor movement.

In the :doc:`next section <part3>` of the tutorial, we’ll dive into something a little more active:
combat. We’ll set up a health component, and teach actors how to attack.
