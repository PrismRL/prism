Prism
=====

A comprehensive traditional roguelike engine, built on top of `LÃ–VE <https://love2d.org/>`_.

Getting started
---------------

Check out :doc:`the tutorial <making-a-roguelike/part1>` for a guided walk-through
of creating a game, or just :doc:`install prism <installation>` and start hacking away.

"Traditional" roguelike?
------------------------

Prism is geared towards classic roguelike games like `NetHack <https://www.nethack.org/>`_ or 
`Brogue <https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/>`_, turn-based games set in randomly generated grid levels. 
Other turn-based tactics games might also be a good fit.
