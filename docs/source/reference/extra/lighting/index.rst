Lighting module
===============

This module adds a dynamic lighting system to cast light in a level and base an :lua:class:`Actor`'s
vision on the light level.

Load it with the following:

.. code-block:: lua

   prism.loadModule("prism/extra/lighting")

A demo project is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/PrismRL/lighting-demo>`_.
