Spectrum
========

The spectrum module extends the core engine with features like a display, camera, game states, and
more. You don't `have` to use anything here, but we try to make it applicable to as many games as
possible. Its classes can be accessed with the ``spectrum`` global, e.g. ``spectrum.Display``.
