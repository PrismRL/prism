--- An 'Action' is a command that affects a discrete change in the game state.
--- An Action consists of an owner, a name, a list of targets, and a list of target objects.
--- See Target for more.
--- @class Action : Object
--- @field time number The time it takes to perform this action. Lower is better.
--- @field silent boolean A silent action doesn't generate messages
--- @field owner Actor The actor taking the action.
--- @field source Actor? An object granting the owner of the action this action. A wand's zap action is a good example.
--- @field targets Target[]
--- @field targetObjects Object[]
--- @field requiredComponents Component[]
--- @overload fun(owner: Actor, targets: Target[]): Action
local Action = prism.Object:extend("Action")
Action.time = 100

--- Constructor for the Action class.
---@param owner Actor The actor that is performing the action.
---@param targets? Object[] An optional list of target actors. Not all actions require targets.
---@param source? Actor An optional actor indicating the source of that action, for stuff like a wand or scroll.
