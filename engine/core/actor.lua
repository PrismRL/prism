--- Entities in the game, including the player, enemies, and items.
--- Actors are composed of Components that define their state and behavior.
--- For example, an actor may have a Sight component that determines their field of vision, explored tiles,
--- and other related aspects.
--- @class Actor : Entity
--- @field level? Level The level the actor is on.
--- @overload fun(): Actor
local Actor = prism.Entity:extend("Actor")

--- @alias ActorFactory fun(...): Actor

--- Constructor for an actor.
--- Initializes and copies the actor's fields from its prototype.
--- @param self Actor
function Actor:__new()
   self.super.__new(self)
end

--- Components
--

--- Adds a component to the entity. This function will check if the component's
--- prerequisites are met and will throw an error if they are not.

--- Actions
