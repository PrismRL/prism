--- An 'Actor' represents entities in the game, including the player, enemies, and items.
--- Actors are composed of Components that define their state and behavior.
--- For example, an actor may have a Sight component that determines their field of vision, explored tiles,
--- and other related aspects.
--- @class Actor : Object
--- @field private position Vector2 An actor's position in the game world.
--- @field name string The string name of the actor, used for display to the user.
--- @field char string The character to draw for this actor.
--- @field components Component[] A table containing all of the actor's component instances. Generated at runtime.
--- @field componentCache table This is a cache for component queries, reducing most queries to a hashmap lookup.
--- @overload fun(): Actor
local Actor = prism.Object:extend("Actor")
Actor.position = nil
Actor.name = "actor"

--- Constructor for an actor.
--- Initializes and copies the actor's fields from its prototype.
--- @param self Actor
