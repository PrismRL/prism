--- You can also construct an anonymous node like:
--- prism.BehaviorTree.Node(function(level, actor) return true end)
--- For this reason simple nodes like succeeders, inverters, failers etc.

--- Override this method in your own nodes, or supply an anonymous function
--- to the constructor to create an 'anonymous node'. While we pass in self here
--- it's generally not a good idea to store state on the nodes itself, but it can be
--- fine for caching a path for instance.
