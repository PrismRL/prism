--- The `Component` class represents a component that can be attached to actors.
--- Components are used to add functionality to actors. For instance, the `Moveable` component
--- allows an actor to move around the map. Components are essentially data storage that can
--- also grant actions.
--- @class Component : Object
--- @field requirements Component[] A list of components (prototypes) the actor must first have, before this can be applied.
--- @field owner Entity The Actor this component is composing. This is set by Actor when a component is added or removed.
--- @overload fun(): Component
local Component = prism.Object:extend("Component")
Component.requirements = {}

--- Checks whether an actor has the required components to attach this component.
--- @param entity Entity The actor to check the requirements against.
--- @return boolean meetsRequirements the actor meets all requirements, false otherwise.
