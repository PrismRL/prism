---Called when the window is resized, for example if the user resizes the window, or if love.window.setMode is called with an unsupported width or height in fullscreen and the window chooses the closest appropriate size.
---
---Calls to love.window.setMode will '''only''' trigger this event if the width or height of the window after the call doesn't match the requested width and height. This can happen if a fullscreen mode is requested which doesn't match any supported mode, or if the fullscreen type is 'desktop' and the requested width or height don't match the desktop resolution.

---Called when text has been entered by the user. For example if shift-2 is pressed on an American keyboard layout, the text '@' will be generated.
---
---Although Lua strings can store UTF-8 encoded unicode text just fine, many functions in Lua's string library will not treat the text as you might expect. For example, #text (and string.len(text)) will give the number of ''bytes'' in the string, rather than the number of unicode characters. The Lua wiki and a presentation by one of Lua's creators give more in-depth explanations, with some tips.
---
---The utf8 library can be used to operate on UTF-8 encoded unicode text (such as the text argument given in this function.)
